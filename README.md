A big challenge financial instituitions face is the decision of whom they'll give a credit card to. This comes with a lot of dificulties due to its strong relation to the survival of the company itself. If they give too many credit cards with high enough limits, the instituion won't be expected to last. Added to this, we should consider all the factors that may affect our decision, such as wages, age, time they've been in the workforce and so forth. 

This notebook aims to explore the dataset, prepare the data, and use machine learning algorithms to predict credit card approvals. We'll be using the  [UCI Credit Card dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval)

###### This notebook is based on [Sayak Paul's Datacamp Project](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/558).
